Multiclass Fish Image Classification
This project aims to classify images of different fish species using deep learning techniques. We explore and compare various approaches, including training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch and leveraging transfer learning with several pre-trained models. The final, best-performing model is deployed in a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

üê† Problem Statement
Fish image classification is a classic computer vision problem with many practical applications, such as automating fish species identification for marine biology research, commercial fishing, and conservation efforts. This project addresses the challenge of accurately classifying fish images into multiple distinct categories.

Our primary goals are to:

Build and train a robust deep learning model for classifying fish images.

Compare and evaluate the performance of a custom CNN against several state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

Develop a user-friendly web application for real-time predictions, allowing users to upload an image and get an instant classification.

üöÄ Skills Acquired
This project provides a hands-on opportunity to learn and apply several key skills in the field of deep learning and machine learning operations (MLOps):

Deep Learning: Understanding the fundamentals of neural networks and CNN architectures.

Python, TensorFlow/Keras: Practical experience using these powerful libraries for model building, training, and evaluation.

Data Preprocessing & Augmentation: Techniques for preparing image data and enhancing model robustness.

Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0) to achieve high accuracy with less data and computational resources.

Model Evaluation: In-depth analysis of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

Model Deployment: Building and deploying a machine learning model as a web application using Streamlit.

Visualization: Creating plots for training history (accuracy and loss) to gain insights into model training.

üìÇ Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of various fish species, organized into folders corresponding to each species. The data is loaded and preprocessed efficiently using TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator. Due to the size of the dataset, it is not included directly in this repository but is assumed to be a zipped file.

üõ†Ô∏è Approach
1. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
Rescaling: All images are rescaled to a [0, 1] range to standardize input for the models.

Data Augmentation: We apply techniques such as random rotation, zoom, and horizontal flipping to artificially expand the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen images.

2. Model Training
Custom CNN: A Convolutional Neural Network is built and trained from scratch to serve as a baseline model.

Transfer Learning: Five popular pre-trained models are utilized:

VGG16

ResNet50

MobileNet

InceptionV3

EfficientNetB0

The pre-trained models are fine-tuned on our fish dataset by freezing the base layers and training a new classification head.

The best-performing model (based on validation accuracy) is saved in .h5 format for later use.

3. Model Evaluation
All trained models are evaluated on a held-out test set using a comprehensive set of metrics:

Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Metrics that provide a more nuanced understanding of model performance, especially with class imbalances.

Confusion Matrix: A table that visualizes the performance of an algorithm, showing where the model's predictions went wrong.

The training history (accuracy and loss plots) is also visualized to understand the learning process for each model.

4. Deployment
The best-performing model is integrated into a Streamlit web application. This application allows users to:

Upload an image: Users can easily upload a fish image from their local machine.

Get a prediction: The application uses the trained model to predict the fish species.

View confidence scores: The predicted category is displayed along with the model's confidence score for that prediction.
